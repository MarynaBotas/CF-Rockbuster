# CF-Rockbuster
For the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program project, I developed moderately complex SQL queries to solve business problems for the movie rental company Rockbuster Stealth LLC. I presented the results through compelling visualizations and shared insights and technical details using Excel and a data dictionary.

## Objectives
How can Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a film rental company with a history of a global presence in the marketplace, effectively respond to the intense competition posed by streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime? The management team's goal is to leverage its current film licenses into an online video rental service. To formulate an informed business strategy for 2020, the team seeks data-driven answers to a series of business questions.

## Key Questions
•	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

•	What was the average rental duration for all videos?

•	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

•	Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

•	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data
The dataset containts information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history and addresses, loaded into a PostgreSQL database.
